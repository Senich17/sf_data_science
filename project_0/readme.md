### What case we are solving?
We need to write a program that finds a given number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- Computer guesses an integer from 1 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" it means that we need to "write a program that guesses that number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether a random number is greater or less than the one we need.

**Quality metric:**
- The result is estimated by the number of attempts with 1000 repetitions.

**What do we practice?:**
- Learning to write good Python code.
